#0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

//* In this project, I continued to practice object-oriented programming in Python. I learned about class methods, static methods, class vs instance attributes, andbhow to use the special `__str__` and `__repr__` methods. *//

#file descriptions, names and prototypes/functions to use
0. Simple rectangle
Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
#file: 0-rectangle.py
1. Real definition of a rectangle
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 0-rectangle.py)
#file: 1-rectangle.py
/** functions to include **/
#prototype/function >> def __init__(self, width=0, height=0):
/*To identify all the features of the rectangel*/
2. Area and Perimeter
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 1-rectangle.py)
#file: 2-rectangle.py
3. String representation
